## React Fibonacci Calculator by Evaldo Silva

A simple Fibonacci Calculator that uses an ASP .Net api made in [another project that I've made](https://github.com/evaldosilva/restful-api-aspnet46-on-the-fly). Both are at my GitHub page. It is hosted at [http://www.reactfibonaccicalc.rf.gd](http://www.reactfibonaccicalc.rf.gd) for tests.
It uses axios ([https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)) to consume the endpoint.

### Usage:

Type the max level of the sequence that you want to see and it will consume the api's endpoint to return the results. Beware with the level that you want (max 999).
